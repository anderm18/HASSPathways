As a result, accurate predictions of the future are critical for the public and private sector alike. This course introduces students to the empirical techniques used by professional economists in business, government and financial sectors to model the complex processes generating data through time and to make real world forecasts. The steps and methods required to develop a forecast-from understanding the properties of time-series data to forecast evaluation-are defined. Topics include modeling trends, seasonality and cycles, ARMA and ARIMA models, forecast combination, vector-autoregression, and nonlinear methods. All these topics and the relevant techniques will be illustrated using economic and financial data.",
