      "description": "Self-organization has become increasingly important in science and engineering. Self-assembly of molecular structures are critical to nanotechnology; self-organizing swarms of insects are modeled in biology and robotics, and so on. But recursive loops in which things govern themselves are also foundational to society. Indigenous societies are renowned for their ecological self-stabilization. Wikipedia, Open Sources Software, and other means of “crowdsourcing” offer new visions for a more democratic civil society.",

Students will learn how to think and act within whole systems and design solutions that identify and push on leverage points in these systems. This process will bring analysis and design together in a multitude of ways, and the course can be thought of as a hybrid seminar/studio course, where students will learn about many design principles and practices and apply these lessons in practice, forming feedback loops between theory and action. At their best, students will transform systems from a degenerative state, to a sustainable one, and beyond to achieve regenerative systems.",

Non-idiomatic improvisation is spontaneous music that does not attempt to replicate or realize a particular historical style (such as swing or bebop jazz), but rather emphasizes the unique creative input of the performers to create original music. Among the techniques explored will be conduction, musical games, graphic and text scores, and cell-structure improvisation. Students will also be coached in techniques to expand and develop musical ideas individually and as a framework for group improvisation. No prior experience with improvisation is required, and participants from any musical background, including electronic and computer music, are encouraged to join. Repertoire and practices will be tailored to the make-up of the group.",
